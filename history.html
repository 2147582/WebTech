                    &nbsp; &nbsp; The World Wide Web project was first proposed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee during his time as a software engineer in CERN. His proposal document was initially titled “Information Management: A Proposal”. <br>

                        The first web page was created and hosted on the NeXT computer in the year 1990, and it was the time when the first web page was published. By the year 1993, CERN announced that world wide web can be used by anyone. On the year 1994 went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and found World Wide Web Consortium, also known as W3C.
